        "(Optional) before adding the noodles, remove the pot from the heat and allow it to cool slightly. Using a stick blender, roughly chop the soup mixture. The aim is to roughly chop, rather than blend to a smooth consistency. Be mindful that blending hot food can be dangerous due to spills and splashes, ensure that you are using an appropriate container to minimise spills and splashes. Return the pot to the heat and bring the soup back to a simmer",
